Some simple C programs designed to work on Linux systems

1. Print the contents of a file, adding a blank line after each line of text.
2. Given a polinomial, calculate its value in a given point x, using Horner's schema and more processes.
3. Implement the following process system:
                            1
                          /   \
                        2     3
      1 - reads text from the standard input.
      2 - prints the digits from the read text to the standard output
      3 - transform all lower case letters from the read text into upper case and prints them to the standard output
4. Consists of two programs, a client and a server. The clients transmits the server a username and the server returns the client the number of active processes of the user.
